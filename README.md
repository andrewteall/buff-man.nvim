!["Buff-Man.nvim screenshot"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbffe90f-8947-4afc-b005-cb271c013d64)
## Requirements

- Neovim â‰¥ v0.9
- (Optional) A patched [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- (Optional) [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons)

## Installation

You can install Buff-Man.nvim with your plugin manager of choice. If you use
`lazy.nvim`, simply add to your plugin list:

```lua
-- Lua
return {
  'andrewteall/buff-man.nvim',
  opts = {}
}
```

## Configuration

Buff-Man.nvim is configured with the following defaults.

```lua
    opts = {
        -- Allow nvim-web-devicons to be used in the buffer line.
        use_icons = false,

            -- only use a couple keymaps. Instead of overriding them all you can
            -- set set `use_keymaps` to false and the use the
            -- `set_keymaps_for_buffer_manger(keymaps)` function to set only
            -- the keymaps you want to use. There are additional parameters that
            -- must be provided if doing this and can be found in
            -- `lua/buff-man/config.lua. It's probably best to copy that keymaps
            -- table and edit it to your liking. This will rarely be needed as
            -- you can just edit the keymaps below and set the keymap to "" if
            -- you don't wish to use it.

## Usage

Open the Buffer Manager window with `:BuffManOpen`. This will open Buffer
Manager in the last mode you were using.

Alternatively you can open the Buffer Manager window with `:BuffManBufferOpen`
or `:BuffManMarkOpen` to open the Buffer Manager in Buffer mode or Mark mode
respectively.

You can navigate Marked files with the `:BuffManMarkNext` and `:BuffManMarkPrev`
commands and toggle a file being marked outside of the Buffer Window with the
`:BuffManMarkToggle` command.

A typical use case is to map one of all of these to a keymap.

When the Buffer Manager is open you can use "\<ESC\>" to close the window and
"?" to show the help window. Neither of the keymaps can be remapped in the
configureation to provide a way to always close the window and show the help.
